# ðŸŽ¥ Motion Detection with OpenCV

This is a simple yet effective motion detection project built with Python and OpenCV. It uses your computer's webcam to monitor any movement in the environment and takes a snapshot when motion is detected. Each captured frame is saved locally and logged with a timestamp in a CSV file for future reference.

Ideal for basic security setups, activity monitoring, or just experimenting with computer vision!

## What This Project Does

- Starts your webcam and captures video feed in real time
- Continuously compares the current frame with a reference frame
- Detects motion by analyzing pixel differences
- When movement is detected:
  - Saves the frame as an image
  - Writes a timestamp + image path into a CSV log file
- Displays the video feed with motion bounding boxes
- Press Q to quit anytime

## How It Works 

1. **Webcam Input**  
   Uses cv2.VideoCapture(0) to access the default webcam.

2. **Frame Processing**  
   - Resizes frames for faster processing using imutils
   - Converts frames to grayscale and applies Gaussian Blur to reduce noise

3. **Reference Frame Update**  
   - Every 30 frames, the reference frame is updated to account for lighting changes or small ambient changes

4. **Motion Detection**  
   - Uses cv2.absdiff() to compare the current frame with the reference
   - Applies thresholding and contour detection
   - Ignores very small contours to avoid false positives (e.g., small lighting shifts)

5. **Logging and Saving**  
   - If a valid motion is found, saves the frame in the captures/ directory
   - Appends the timestamp and image path to a CSV file in logs/motion_log.csv
